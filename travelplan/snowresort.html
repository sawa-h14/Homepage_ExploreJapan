                Niseko has developed into an international ski resort, with a vibrant and diverse community of visitors and residents from many different countries.

                Hakuba, nestled in the northern Japanese Alps within Nagano Prefecture, stands as one of Japan's premier snow resort destinations.
                It was once the site of the Winter Olympics. 
                When one hears the word "snowy mountains," one has the image of access being difficult, 
                but many of Hakuba's ski resorts can be reached by bus. The easy accessibility from Tokyo is also attractive, 
                taking about 2 hours and 30 minutes by Shinkansen and bus, or about 4 hours by car.

                Visitors to Hakuba Valley are unanimous in their praise of the quality of the snow and the spectacular natural surroundings.
                Hakuba Valley is located in the Northern Alps, a mountain range of 3,000-meter-high peaks. 
                The high elevation of the mountains results in low winter temperatures and dry, silky snow.
                From the tops and slopes of the mountains, you can see the foothills of the Northern Alps.
                  Many people become addicted to powder landing while surrounded by beautiful nature once they experience it.
