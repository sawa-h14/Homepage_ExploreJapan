              <p><a href="https://www.kyoto.travel/en/" target="_blank">Kyoto</a>, which was the capital of Japan more than 150 years ago, has many historical sites. There you will see a lot of Japanese architecture.</p>
              <p>
                Among them, Kiyomizu-dera Temple,a historic temple with a history of about 1,200 years, is a very standard place that attracts many tourists.
                The pillars of the temple are assembled by skillfully combining lumber with each other.
                Amazingly, not a single nail is used in the pillars supporting the main hall of Kiyomizu-dera Temple.
                At Kiyomizu-dera, about 1,000 mountain maples planted on the temple grounds turn red, yellow, and orange in autumn.

              <p>If you are visiting Kyoto, you should not miss Kinkakuji and Ginkakuji temples.</p>
              <p>
                If you are visiting Kyoto, you cannot miss Kinkakuji Temple. 
                The temples are decorated in gold. Gold foil is applied to the temple to represent the golden color of the temple. 
                The first Kinkakuji was built in 1408. At that time, however, it was destroyed by fire many times. 
                Each time it was rebuilt, it was rebuilt in the same manner. 
                It is said to represent the economic wealth and riches of the local community. 
                You are not allowed to enter the interior of the Golden Pavilion, but you can easily view the interior of the Golden Pavilion from a distance.

          <h2>Itsukushima Shrine</h2>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
              <p>
                I would like to introduce a mysterious spot in Japan, <a href="https://www.itsukushimajinja.jp/en/index.html" target="_blank">Itsukushima Shrine</a>. 
                Itsukushima is an island in the western part of the Inland Sea of Japan, located in the northwest of Hiroshima Bay.
              </p>
              <p>
                Itsukushima Shrine is a place that can be enjoyed in completely different ways depending on the tide.
                 At high tide, the graceful shrine pavilions appear to float in the sea, and at low tide, visitors can walk to the Otorii (Grand Gate).
                Tide times and tidal levels change with the seasons. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometimes the ebb and flow is at night, but Itsukushima Shrine is even more mysterious when illuminated.
                Because the entire island was worshipped as an island of God, the shrine was built not on land, but on the tidal waters.
              </p>

                It takes less than 5 hours to get there from Tokyo by Shinkansen and ferry.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you want to see this shrine at both high and low tide, you will need at least about 6 hours.
                You can also enjoy sightseeing on the island while waiting for the tide to rise.

                If you do not have enough time to travel, <a href="https://www.senso-ji.jp/english/" target="_blank">Senso-ji</a> may be the best choice. Senso-ji is one of most popular temples in Tokyo.
                Senso-ji Temple is the oldest temple in Tokyo, with a history of about 1,400 years.
              </p>

            <div class="column">
              <p>
                The Kaminarimon, meaning "Thunder Gate," is the most renowned attraction in Senso-ji, 
                and its large red lanterns, which have an outstanding impact, are a symbol of the area.
                It features two statues: the God of Thunder on the left side and the Wind God on the right side.
                They are dedicated with the wish to protect the temple from wind and flood damage.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can easily reach here by bus or train.
